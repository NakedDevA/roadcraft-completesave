Roadcraft completesave editor by NakedDave. 

## No warranty, backup your save folder first, I am not responsible for you losing your progress

to run with python: (make sure you have python 3.13.2 at least) 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python completesaveeditor.py
```

or if you are happy with it just run the included .exe which does the same thing

## how to use it:

Run the tool, pick your CompleteSave file, make changes, hit save. 
Editing simple things like money / xp / company name is a good place to start. I've not tested everything you can do; just because the generated save file is valid doesn't mean the game won't be upset (for example, if you add non-existent trucks or levels to your unlocks)


## why so elaborate

because the save file format is much much more complicated than the older games. trust me you don't want to do this manually

## I wish this did xyz

It's open source for a reason!
